## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose 
This document outlines the requirements for the Bank System, a functional interface for managing personal finances by using the offered products.   
### 1.2 Product Scope
The Bank's objective is to create an accurate stimulation of a real world Bank system with its roles of operations being close to today's well known banks that offer checking, savings and credit card accounts. 
### 1.3 Definitions acronyms

### 1.4 References

### 1.5 Overview

## Overall Description
### 2.1 Product Perspective
This is a project for our Software Engineering course- spring 2020, created to practice and demonstrate our OOP solution to a SWE problem. Bank System is a distributed system with a large DB of customers' and accounts' informations.
### 2.2 Product Functions
A user can perform all the well-known operations of a real life bank. Account owners can interact with their accounts through an ATM or at a bank branch with the help of a teller to modify their account. New customers can become account holders by visiting a bank branch. 
### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
Users can be either customers or to-be-customers. Customers will be given a virtual card, a card without a strip number but with a chip number, upon opening a new account. The card allows interactions with the account through an ATM. Without the card, customers can get access to their account through bank branches. 
### 2.4 Operating Environment
The software is a distributed software that will operate over a network.
